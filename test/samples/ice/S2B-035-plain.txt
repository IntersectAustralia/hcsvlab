Antarctica 
The least visited most isolated place on earth 
More people bought Ringo Starr's last solo album than live here 
Fourteen million square kilometres one and a half times the size of Australia of wind blasted ice into which only a fool would stumble unprepared 
I was just such a fool 
You see I'm trapped 
Trapped in an endless sea of ice 
The same ice that once crushed Shackleton's ship Endurance as though it were no more than a Japanese car 
No one can reach us 
There is no rescue 
We have no option but to wait and hope that the ice always moving however slowly releases us 
It may take weeks or we may go the way of Shackleton 
Clinging forlornly to the few belongings salvaged from our splintered ship marooned in the middle of a frozen ocean hopping from one ice flow to the next listening fearfully to the killer whales beneath us who at any moment could burst through the ice and swallow us whole 
My god 
How did I get here 
This is not my beautiful home 
Behind me four thousand kilometres north lies comfort and warmth and everything I love and ahead South ever south lies Antarctica 
Will I ever get there 
What on earth possessed me to try 
It all began just one week ago in a distant mystic city they call Hobart 
It was here that I boarded the German vessel Icebird chartered by the Australian government to resupply its Antarctic stations 
As I hoisted the family flag my old school motto came ringing back to me 
Worse things happen at sea 
Now at last I'd find out what they meant 
Down on the wharf the air was thick with emotion as family and friends farewelled loved ones many of whom wouldn't be returning for more than a year 
It was a powerful moment 
As we readied for departure I watched people sobbing uncontrollably and felt a lump in my throat 
Touching that my absence should affect people so 
I didn't have the heart to till them I'd be back in five weeks 
As the ship finally pulled away from the wharf I felt a great sense of relief 
We were underway at last and not before time 
That Dixie band had really been giving me the shits 
Oh dear 
Sea sickness so soon 
I decided to find my cabin and take the weight off my guts 
Clearly this wasn't going to be a pleasure cruise 
Determined to be a happy camper I snuggled down for my first night at sea 
Antarctica by ship is one of the world's great journeys 
We're heading to Casey one of three Australian Antarctic stations 
To get there we must negotiate some of the stormiest oceans in the world deadly icebergs and several hundred kilometres of pack ice 
With luck it will take just seven days 
On day two our luck ran out 
We hit the legendary roaring forties and the ugly seas they're famous for 
Well we've encountered a bit of bad weather here on the first few days out 
But fortunately most people are taking it in their stride and we're hopeful of something a bit calmer 
Unless you've experienced a ship rolling in high seas it's hard to explain the difficulties it presents 
Even simple tasks become dangerous 
And I was one of the lucky ones 
At least nobody was calling me sickbag the sailor 
Excuse me sir 
I understand you've been ah fairly sick since we ah hit the ocean 
Oh well just slightly 
Yeah 
Just slightly 
Well what exactly does this sea sickness feel like 
Yeah 
Um basically you feel a queasiness in your stomach and then that builds up and you start coming up to a like it's going to come up 
You get sort of yellow inside your head and then it creeps down to your stomach and everything you've eaten appears to be attached to a rubber band and back it comes 
Just before it comes up a sensation of panic and you reach for your sickbag 
Which you always carry with you 
Which well since I sprayed a pile of vomit all over the floor of um the toilet back there I carry the bag with me ready on the draw and then basically in there and um it ends up feeling very warm in your hands which is also a bit disconcerting 
Seasickness is incurable and the only way to deal with it is to try and put the nausea out of your mind by thinking of something wholesome such as a cup of fat with a hair in it 
Either that or get some fresh air something everybody did when we spotted our first iceberg just three days out of Hobart 
Call that an iceberg 
I've got bigger things in my martini 
Huh 
It's said that the two best events on a polar voyage are the first and last sight of ice 
Our first iceberg had occurred unusually far north which accounted for its lack of size but as we new age guys know size isn't everything 
Even small icebergs can be dangerous 
Luckily the ship was well prepared 
This is the bow the pointy end of the ship and as you might expect it is specially strengthened to cut through the ice 
Allow me to demonstrate 
Unfortunately the excitement of the first iceberg was shortlived 
No others were immediately to be seen and soon the tedium of life at sea began to sink in 
Fortunately we were all assigned chores to keep ourselves busy 
Despite my status as ship celebrity I welcomed the opportunity 
This is bloody disgraceful 
At the ABC we've got news readers to do this kind of thing 
At nights we'd gather round the bar and sing old songs of the sea 
Having crossed sixty degrees south we were now formally inside Antarctic waters 
This was both a wonderful and a terrible thing 
Why terrible 
Because traditionally at this time King Neptune comes aboard the ship and welcomes new comers with a primitive initiation ritual not recognised by the Geneva convention and at sea there's nowhere to hide 
My school was right 
Worse things do happen at sea 
We're about six hours away from the pack ice which may or may not allow us to get into Casey 
The bridge is closed due to the bad weather conditions 
The captain doesn't want anyone up there 
The air is freezing 
The water is more than freezing in fact it's littered with tiny icebergs which keep thumping into the ship 
Basically it's as if we're sailing to the very end of the world 
Pretty exciting really 
Mind you so is sex and it's a hell of a lot warmer 
We were now well amongst the ice 
The time had come to find out what Antarctica had in store for those about to spend a year here 
I spoke to Joan Russell who was heading down for her second winter and to Angie Rose on her way south for the first time 
Angie has her expectations but what's she really gonna find 
Er many things that she will see in a year at Casey that you can't imagine the beauty of it 
And the social stuff is beyond the imagining too because it's a situation that not many of us have ever been in before 
By the way if you're wondering what that ah banging noise is while we're talking here that's because we're 
Sorry if you can't hear it at home but that's nature for you 
What a bugger 
You're really truly here now 
This sure looks like Antarctica to me 
Yeah 
In fact seeing this er today is is really brought it home to me 
The the trip up until now we were still being oh well yes We're we're going somewhere 

But but now we've arrived 
And it's yeah it's fantastic 
I get the impression that I'm coming into quite a closed culture 
Is that true 
Yes 
Why 
Why why is it like that 
I guess nobody wants to assault the myth 
That's on the most trivial level 
Of of us all having been heroic and ah we've been there 
We've seen that and survived and we're on our way home 
Um perhaps nobody wants to touch on the sore spots either and the hollowness 
You know the longing 
The that's the element of isolation and being away from home that isn't talked about 
The hole in your heart 
Which is 
Mmm 
Is sex an a big issue in Antarctica 
Your sexuality 
Is one of the layers that you hang up and and put aside in order you know in exchange for first prize 
I mean look at it out there 
You know that's one of the things that you set aside 
I guess the more pertinent issue is companionship 
Yeah 
It's companionship and the I I did I personally experienced a a sickening longing for physical contact 
You know for hugging and and laughing and touching not necessarily sexual at all 
Right 
Do you think that's common 
I imagine it's almost universal 
It's just not talked about 
We're deep inside the ship 
Right down inside the bow which as you may remember is the pointy part of the ship 
Now normally a boring and unremarkable place to be except when the ship happens to be breaking ice in which case the sound is quite extraordinary 
The crash of the ice against the bow was constant as was the daylight 
This being Antarctica's summer we were now literally in the land of the midnight sun and our sleep patterns were going crazy 
The only way I could get some rest was to fool my body into thinking it was night 
Fortunately though my head is a brunette my body is a blonde 
Sailing ever southwards into the heart of lightness some ugly truths began to emerge 
As we head into the Antarctic we've been made well aware that many possible dangers await us and we've been told that at all times we must have this the Antarctic Field Manual in our hands 
It has all sort of survival tips should we fall into a crevasse should our helicopter crash into the ocean 
Little things like that 
But perhaps the most controversial part of this manual is page one hundred and thirty 
Emergency sources of food and I quote penguins may be killed by stunning them with a blow to the head and then breaking and cutting the neck Cut the penguin down the front to remove the breast meat 
Penguin stew is palatable provided the external fat is removed before cooking and penguin liver is excellent 

Mmm mmm 
For us penguins were only the start 
As we farewelled the Golden Orcas we experienced an unfamiliar sensation 
Complete stillness 
Only eighty kilometres from Casey the Icebird had ground to a halt 
We were trapped 
Clearly there were two options 
Sit tight or do something stupid 
The choice was obvious 
Well out of bad things good things come 
As you can see we're stuck fast in the ice 
We could in fact be here for weeks 
A real bummer but the good thing is it's a great opportunity to practice my golf 
The Royal Antarctic is one of the world's great golf courses 
The clubhouse a beauty 
I like to have a drink there after a round and the course itself definitely of international standard 
This first hole for instance about four hundred and twenty yards 
Perhaps the only real hazards are the water traps 
Fall in those and you're dead 
And of course the occasional tree 
And of course the other problem Weddell seals 
Sorry 
By the time I returned to the Icebird a decision had been made to transport key personnel to Casey by helicopter and hope that the ship could break through the ice later 
Excitedly I donned my survival gear 
Well should I unfortunately go hurtling into the sea ice I am fortunately magnificently dressed for killer whales to come hunting for me
